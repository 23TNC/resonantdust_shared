//! Client ↔ gate wire protocol (JSON over the WS).
//!
//! **Shared, single source of truth.** The gateway *receives* [`ClientMsg`] and
//! *sends* [`GateMsg`]; the client (native NPC driver, and the wasm view-backing
//! build) does the mirror — so both message types derive `Serialize` +
//! `Deserialize` here, and nobody hand-mirrors the contract. Feature-gated
//! (`protocol`) so the SpacetimeDB modules that link this crate for its codec
//! don't pull `serde_json`.
//!
//! The client subscribes to tables (the gate fans out live rows from the shards)
//! and calls reducers; the gate routes a plain relay to the owning shard, while
//! `propose_action` / `claim_or_login` are intercepted and handled gate-side
//! (recipe validation + cross-shard apply, session establishment). A deliberately
//! thin, stable contract — table/reducer names may later give way to
//! intent-shaped messages.
//!
//! Numbers ride the wire as strings where they exceed JS's safe-integer range
//! (`server_micros`); row payloads are coerced per-field downstream.
